# Remix Image Uploads

This is an example replicating Slack's message input in Remix.

- You can drag and drop images, or upload them, onto the message input.
- They show immediately in a pending "upload" state while they're uploaded in the background to the cloud.
- Once the upload completes, they're replaced with the uploaded image and can be submitted with your form.

The draft message and any images in it is fully persisted to the server, so you can start a message on one device and finish it on another.
