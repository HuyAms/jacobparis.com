# Autosave form inputs on change or blur

This is an example demonstrating forms that persist automatically

- They useFetcher instead of submit so changes aren't lost on navigation

TODO: update to use the [useDebounceFetcher](https://github.com/jacobparis-insiders/jacobparis.com/blob/main/app/examples/remix-image-uploads/useDebounceFetcher.ts) hook
TODO: Add landing page + Get started button to create a custom ID so users changes don't conflict
