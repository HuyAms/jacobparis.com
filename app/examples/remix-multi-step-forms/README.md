### Multi-step form demo with animated route transitions

This is an example demonstrating forms that cross many pages, inspired by Linear's onboarding
- Data is submitted at every step to a form session object
- Users can navigate forward and backward through the form
- Users can jump to pages in the form out of order
- The server can infer, based on data in form session, whether a user should be allowed to access a certain page, and redirect them to the appropriate route if not

Each page loads with animated route transitions
