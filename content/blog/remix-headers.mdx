If you're like most devs, you haven't spent very much time thinking about the response headers your server is sending to the client.

With Remix, you need to know the difference between document and data requests, and learn how to set both route and loader headers.

## Document requests use route headers

On a full page load, Remix will run all of your loaders in parallel and then use the data to server-side render your page body. Then, it takes both the rendered body and the exported document headers from the leaf route<SideNote> Remix supports nested routes, and some routes can act as parents of other routes. The leaf route is the bottom-most route with no children of its own.</SideNote> and sends them to the client.

Route headers are set using the `headers` export from your route file. To set a header named `Server`, you can do either of these.

```ts
export const headers: HeadersFunction = () => {
  return {
    Server: "Remix",
  }
}

export const headers: HeadersFunction = () => {
  const headers = new Headers()
  headers.set("Server", "Remix")
  return headers
}
```

## Data requests use loader headers

Loader headers come into play whenever Remix needs to fetch data on your behalf.

- On a client-side navigation
- a useFetcher call
- a prefetch

Data requests are for a single loader at a time, so Remix will often make multiple requests in parallel to fetch all the data it needs.

Not every loader will run on every request. If you do a client-side navigation from one deeply nested route to a sibling route, any common parent loaders will not re-run.

Headers for data requests are set directly in the loader response object.

```ts
export async function loader() {
  const items = await fetchData()

  return json(items, {
    headers: {
      Server: "Remix",
    },
  })
}
```

## Merging headers

If you want certain headers to be set consistently on both document and data requests, it's up to you to merge them together.

You have access to the loaderHeaders object in your route headers function, so you can do something like this to set them automatically

```ts
export const headers: HeadersFunction = ({
  loaderHeaders,
}) => {
  const headers = new Headers()
  const settableHeaders = [
    "Cache-Control",
    "Vary",
    "Server-Timing",
  ]
  for (const header of settableHeaders) {
    if (loaderHeaders.has(header)) {
      headers.set(header, loaderHeaders.get(header)!)
    }
  }

  return headers
}
```

To make it reusable, save it in a file named `defaults.server.ts` and import it into your route files.

```ts
// in any route file
export { headers } from "~/defaults.server.ts"
```
