Remix's Defer API is a feature that allows you to return an unresolved Promise from a loader. The page will server-side render without waiting for the promise to resolve, and then when it finally does, the client will re-render with the new data.

This works especially well with queued jobs, where a user may try to look at result data before the job has finished processing. In this case, we can return a Promise that will resolve when the job is finished, and the client will re-render with the new data.

BullMQ is a modern, fast, and robust queue system for Node.js. It is a successor to the popular Bull library, and is built on top of Redis. If you've [integrated BullMQ into your app](/content/bullmq-integration-guide), you can use the Defer API to return a Promise that will resolve when the job is finished.

```tsx
import { defer, redirect } from "@remix-run/node"
import { processItemQueue } from "~/queue.server"

export async function loader({ params }: LoaderArgs) {
  const hash = params.hash
  if (!hash) {
    return redirect("/")
  }

  const job = await processItemQueue.getJob(hash)
  if (!job) {
    return redirect("/")
  }

  const TIMEOUT_MILLISECONDS = 30 * 1000

  return defer({
    job: job.waitUntilFinished(
      processItemQueue.events,
      TIMEOUT_MILLISECONDS,
    ),
  })
}

export default function Index() {
  const data = useLoaderData()

  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<p> loadingâ€¦ </p>}>
        <Await
          resolve={data.job}
          errorElement={<p>Error loading job</p>}
        >
          {(results) => <pre>{results}</pre>}
        </Await>
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  )
}
```

As a next step, you can use [event streams](/content/remix-stream-bullmq-queue) to update the page as the job progresses.
