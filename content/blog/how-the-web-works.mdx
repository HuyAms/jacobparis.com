## Cookies

Cookies are a browser feature that allows websites to store data on the client.

Cookies are sent to the server with every request, so they can be used to store information about the user's session.

The browser will update the cookie whenever the server returns a `Set-Cookie` header in its response.

## Form submissions are navigations

When you submit a form, the browser will navigate to the URL specified in the `action` attribute of the form, or the current URL if no `action` is specified.

This gets stored in the browser's history, so you can press the back button to go back to the previous page before submission.

Forms submitted as POST requests are also stored in the browser's history. If you've ever pressed the back button and seen a warning about resubmitting the form, this is why.

## Forms submit GET requests by default

By default, forms will send data to the server using the `GET` method and the contents of the form will be encoded into the URL as query parameters.

## Forms submit when you press enter

Pressing enter submits most forms by default, as long as one of these conditions is met

- The form has exactly one input, and the input is focused
- The form has a submit button, and a textarea is not focused
