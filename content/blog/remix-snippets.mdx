Remix doesn't have a lot of boilerplate, but there are some functions, like the loader, action, and default export, that are used often enough to warrant a snippet.

VS Code's snippets feature<SideNote> Read more about this in the [VS Code Snippets Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) </SideNote> lets you define a block of text that you can insert by typing a keyword or with a keyboard shortcut.

**You can make snippets for a specific project** by adding them to the `.vscode` folder as a JSON file named `something.code-snippets`

Otherwise, you can add them to your user snippets by opening the command palette and typing `Preferences: Configure User Snippets` and selecting `New Global Snippets File...`. This way it will only apply for you.

Here are some tips for making snippets:

- Let each snippet import the dependencies it needs, rather than assuming they'll be available.
- Use the `'import/no-duplicates': 'warn',` rule in your `.eslintrc` file to prevent duplicate imports. If you have autofix on save, it will automatically merge your imports.
- Don't be afraid to customize these. Maybe most of your loaders have the same auth guards in the first few lines. Add those to the snippet and save yourself some time.

## Example snippet file

Add this to your `.vscode` folder as `remix.code-snippets` or keep it to yourself in your personal preferences.
