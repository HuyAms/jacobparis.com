Remix uses esbuild to bundle your app. When you import a file, esbuild will use its file-loader to copy the file to the public build directory and return the path to the file. This is useful for images, fonts, and other static assets.

A resource route can fetch the image from this path and return it as a response to serve it to the client.

```ts
import { LoaderArgs } from "@remix-run/node"
import image from "./image.jpg"

export async function loader({ request }: LoaderArgs) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)
  url.pathname = image

  const imageBuffer = await fetch(url).then(
    (res) => res.body,
  )

  return new Response(imageBuffer, {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "image/jpeg",
    },
  })
}
```
