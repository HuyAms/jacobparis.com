Tutorials often get outdated, especially in a world where services improve rapidly and developer relations teams are constantly on top of making set up easier.

This guide is a collection of possible integrations with Remix and the best way to get started with them.

## Data handling

This section deals with different databases and adapters that are often used with Remix

### Prisma

Prisma is a popular ORM for handling database interactions. Instead of querying your database directly, you generate a Prisma client that gives you a type-safe API for reading and writing data.

Prisma will also handle migrations for you, so you can make changes to your schema and Prisma will automatically generate the SQL to update your database.

Check out this guide to learn how to [add Prisma to a Remix app](/content/remix-prisma)

### Drizzle

Drizzle is an all-typescript ORM for interacting with relational databases. It gives you type-safe reads and writes, plus automatic migration handling.

## Hosting

This section deals with different hosting options for Remix apps.

To learn more about the capabilities of each option, check out the [hosting guide](/content/where-to-host-remix)

## Fly.io

Fly.io is a platform for running your apps on a global network of servers. It's a great way to get a fast, global deployment for your Remix app.

Remix is natively supported by Fly, so you can get started in minutes by downloading the Fly CLI and run `fly launch`.
