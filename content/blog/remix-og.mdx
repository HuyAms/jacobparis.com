When people share your website, blog posts, or other content on social media, those websites will often display a preview image of your content.

Websites support this through a web standard called Open Graph. Open Graph is a set of tags that you can add to your HTML to tell websites how to present links to your content.

In this guide, you'll learn

- how to set a social preview image that works on Twitter, Facebook, Discord, and more
- how to use Remix to generate a social preview image for your website automatically

## Use a static image

The easiest way to set a social preview image is to use a static image. You can upload an image to your website and use that as the preview image.

For example, if you have an image called `social-preview.png` in your website's `public` folder, you can set the preview image by linking to it with a `meta` tag.<SideNote> Open graph does not support relative links, so you must include the full URL including your website domain in the link.</SideNote>

Remix gives each route a special function for setting meta tags. You can set one in your `root.tsx` to handle your whole site, and then override it with specific ones for pages that need different images.

```tsx
export const meta: MetaFunction = () => {
  return [
    { title: "Website title" },
    {
      property: "og:image",
      content: "https://www.example.com/social-preview.png",
    },
  ]
}
```

## Set open graph tags for Twitter and blog posts

There are many different meta tags that you can set for open graph.<SideNote>Check out [the Open Graph documentation for the OG tags](https://ogp.me/).</SideNote>. These all start with `og:`

Twitter uses a combination of og tags and Twitter-specific tags. In theory it's meant to use the og tags if the twitter ones aren't present, but I've found that behavior to be unreliable in practice. I always set both. Twitter tags start with `twitter:`

The important one you'll want to see is `twitter:card` which tells Twitter how to display the link. The default is `summary` which is a small preview image with a title and description.

- **You will probably want to use `summary_large_image` which is the full size card with a large image**, however as of October 2023 Twitter has stopped showing the title and description along with it, making potentially hard to tell the difference between an image and a link.<SideNote>If you use the large image, I recommend including the title and description in the image itself.</SideNote>
- The image URL is going to be read by the website that is displaying the link, so you need to use a full URL and not a relative path to the image.

Here is the meta function that I use for content on this website. The data comes from my loader which parses markdown and returns its frontmatter.

```tsx
export const meta: MetaFunction<typeof loader> = ({
  data,
}) => {
  if (!data) return [{ title: "Not found" }]

  const titleElements = data.frontmatter.title
    ? [
        { title: data.frontmatter.title },
        {
          name: "twitter:title",
          content: data.frontmatter.title,
        },
        {
          property: "og:title",
          content: data.frontmatter.title,
        },
      ]
    : []

  const descriptionElements = data.frontmatter.description
    ? [
        {
          name: "description",
          content: data.frontmatter.description,
        },
        {
          name: "twitter:description",
          content: data.frontmatter.description,
        },
        {
          property: "og:description",
          content: data.frontmatter.description,
        },
      ]
    : []

  const imageElements = [
    {
      name: "twitter:image",
      content: `https://www.jacobparis.com/content/${data.frontmatter.slug}.png`,
    },
    {
      property: "og:image",
      content: `https://www.jacobparis.com/content/${data.frontmatter.slug}.png`,
    },
    {
      name: "twitter:card",
      content: "summary_large_image",
    },
  ]
  return [
    ...titleElements,
    ...descriptionElements,
    ...imageElements,
    { name: "twitter:site", content: "@jacobmparis" },
    { name: "twitter:creator", content: "@jacobmparis" },
    {
      property: "og:url",
      content: `https://www.jacobparis.com/content/${data.frontmatter.slug}`,
    },
    { property: "og:type", content: "article" },
    { property: "og:site_name", content: "Jacob Paris" },
    { property: "og:locale", content: "en_US" },
  ]
}
```

## Dynamically generate social preview images with Remix

Using a dynamic image is the same process, but instead of linking to a static image, you'll link to an endpoint that generates the image dynamically.

Vercel has first class support for generating social preview images with [Vercel OG](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation), but this requires running on Vercel's edge functions.

The workflow to build it yourself looks like this:

1. Write the JSX for your social preview image
2. Use [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) to turn your JSX into an SVG image
3. Use [resvg-js](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js) to turn your SVG image into a PNG image
4. Return the PNG image from your loader function with a `Content-Type` header of `image/png`

Put that in a resource route<SideNote> A resource route is just a regular Remix route that doesn't return a component, and instead acts as a regular web endpoint.</SideNote> that you can link to from your meta function and you're all set!

Make a new route at `image-generator.tsx` and add a loader function.

```tsx
import satori from "satori"
import { Resvg } from "@resvg/resvg-js"

export async function loader({
  request,
}: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const jsx = <div style="color: black">hello, world</div>

  // From satori docs example
  const svg = await satori(jsx, {
    width: 600,
    height: 400,
    fonts: [
      {
        name: "Roboto",
        // Use `fs` (Node.js only) or `fetch` to read the font as Buffer/ArrayBuffer and provide `data` here.
        data: robotoArrayBuffer,
        weight: 400,
        style: "normal",
      },
    ],
  })

  const resvg = new Resvg(svg)
  const pngData = resvg.render()
  const data = pngData.asPng()

  return new Response(data, {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "image/png",
    },
  })
}
```

## Use dynamic text

This resource route is a regular web endpoint, so you can use query parameters to pass in dynamic text.

```tsx
export async function loader({
  request,
}: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)
  const title = url.searchParams.get("title")
  const description = url.searchParams.get("description")

  const jsx = (
    <div>
      <h1> {title} </h1>
      <p> {description} </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

When you link to this resource route, you can pass in the dynamic text as query parameters.

Remix's meta function has access to the data from its loader function, so you can use that to set the dynamic text.

```tsx
export const meta: MetaFunction<typeof loader> = ({
  data,
}) => {
  const ogUrl = new URL(
    "https://www.example.com/social-preview.png",
  )
  ogUrl.searchParams.set("title", data.title)
  ogUrl.searchParams.set("description", data.description)

  return [
    { title: "Website title" },
    {
      property: "og:image",
      content: ogUrl.toString(),
    },
  ]
}
```

## Use Tailwind for your image HTML

Rather than bundling CSS or messing with inline styles, you may prefer to use Tailwind CSS to style your social preview image.

Satori supports this out of the box, but instead of using the `className` attribute, you'll use the `tw` attribute instead.

Typescript does not love this. You can fix it by adding a custom type definition for the `tw` attribute.

```tsx
declare module "react" {
  interface HTMLAttributes<T> {
    tw?: string
  }
}
```

```tsx
const img = url.searchParams.get("img")

const jsx = (
  <div
    tw="h-full w-full flex flex-col justify-end bg-gray-700 relative"
    style={{
      backgroundImage: img
        ? `url(https://www.jacobparis.com/${img})`
        : "",
      backgroundSize: "1200px 600px",
    }}
  />
)

const svg = await satori(jsx, {
  width: 600,
  height: 400,
})
```

If you're using the [Tailwind CSS Intellisense plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) then you'll also want to add `tw` to the list of attributes that it recognizes.

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.classAttributes": [
    "class",
    "className",
    "tw"
  ]
}
```

## Load fonts from Google Fonts automatically

You can use Google Fonts to load fonts for your social preview images in Remix without needing to download and bundle them with your app.

I've created a small helper function that will fetch them and pass them to Satori.

```tsx
async function getFont(
  font: string,
  weights = [400, 500, 600, 700],
  text = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789/\\!@#$%^&*()_+-=<>?[]{}|;:,.`'’\"–—",
) {
  const css = await fetch(
    `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=${font}:wght@${weights.join(
      ";",
    )}&text=${encodeURIComponent(text)}`,
    {
      headers: {
        // Make sure it returns TTF.
        "User-Agent":
          "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_8; de-at) AppleWebKit/533.21.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.5 Safari/533.21.1",
      },
    },
  ).then((response) => response.text())

  const resource = css.matchAll(
    /src: url\((.+)\) format\('(opentype|truetype)'\)/g,
  )

  return Promise.all(
    [...resource]
      .map((match) => match[1])
      .map((url) =>
        fetch(url).then((response) =>
          response.arrayBuffer(),
        ),
      )
      .map(async (buffer, i) => ({
        name: font,
        style: "normal",
        weight: weights[i],
        data: await buffer,
      })),
  ) as Promise<SatoriOptions["fonts"]>
}
```

To use this, include it in the `fonts` array when you pass your JSX to Satori.

```tsx
const svg = await satori(jsx, {
  width: 600,
  height: 400,
  fonts: await getFont("Inter"),
})
```

You can also load multiple fonts at once.

```tsx
const svg = await satori(jsx, {
  width: 600,
  height: 400,
  fonts: await Promise.all([
    getFont("Inter"),
    getFont("Playfair Display"),
  ]).then((fonts) => fonts.flat()),
})
```

## Optional: Add .png to your article URLs

You can point the `og:image` tag directly at the resource route that generates the images dynamically, but I like to use a URL that looks like a static image.

If you [add `.png` to the end of the URL for this blog post](remix-og.png), you'll get the generated open graph image directly.

Create a new route at `content.$slug[.png].ts` with a loader that fetches the post data and returns a fetch request to the image generator.<SideNote> Since Remix uses the same Request/Response API as the browser, you can return fetch directly from a loader. .</SideNote>

```ts
export async function loader({
  request,
  params,
}: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const { frontmatter } = await getPost(params.slug)

  const url = new URL(request.url)
  const ogUrl = new URL("/image-generator.png", url.origin)
  ogUrl.searchParams.set("title", frontmatter.title)
  ogUrl.searchParams.set(
    "description",
    frontmatter.description,
  )
  ogUrl.searchParams.set("date", frontmatter.timestamp)
  ogUrl.searchParams.set("img", frontmatter.img)

  return fetch(ogUrl)
}
```

Or if you want to cache the image so it isn't regenerated every time, you can [use a server cache with cachified](/content/server-cache).

```ts
return cachified({
  key: ogUrl.toString(),
  cache,
  async getFreshValue() {
    return fetch(ogUrl)
  },
})
```

## Code example

This is the code for the image generator I use for this article as of Nov 3 2023. The [image generation code for this blog is on Github](https://github.com/jacobparis-insiders/jacobparis.com/blob/main/app/blog/generators.blog%5B.png%5D.route.tsx)
