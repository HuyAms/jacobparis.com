title: Use createStateContext to share a useState hook

Despite so many folks touting React's useContext as a state management solution, it really doesn't have anything to do with state management at all.

React Context is about dependency injection. You provide a value to a wrapper component, and then any downstream component can use that value via a useContext hook.

Most of the time I use Context I also want to provide a way to update the value from the child components. I like the useState API, but it needs to be shareable

I've built a helper function called `createStateContext` that takes the same types as useState and returns a tuple of the Context and a hook to use it.

Consider a CheckboxGroup component, which needs to keep track of which checkboxes are checked.

```tsx
const [CheckboxContext, useCheckboxContext] =
  createStateContext<string[]>()

// optional for better error messages
CheckboxContext.displayName = "CheckboxContext"

function CheckboxGroup({ children }) {
  const state = useState<string[]>([])

  return (
    <CheckboxContext.Provider value={state}>
      {children}
    </CheckboxContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

Any child component can use the `useCheckboxContext` hook to get a state and setState function that is shared with all its siblings.

```tsx
const [checkboxes, setCheckboxes] = useCheckboxContext()
```

```tsx
<CheckboxGroup>
  <Checkbox value="foo" />
  <Checkbox value="bar" />
  <Checkbox value="baz" />
</CheckboxGroup>
```

## The hook

```tsx
import React, { useContext } from "react"

export function createStateContext<T>() {
  const StateContext = React.createContext<
    | undefined
    | Readonly<[T, React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<T>>]>
  >(undefined)

  function useStateContext() {
    const tuple = useContext(StateContext)

    if (tuple === undefined) {
      throw new Error(
        `use${StateContext.displayName} must be used within a ${StateContext.displayName}Provider`,
      )
    }

    return tuple
  }

  return [StateContext, useStateContext] as const
}
```
