While working with HTML forms, you'll often end up with query parameters in the URL that don't have a value. For example, if you have a form with a search input and the user submits the form without entering anything, you'll end up with a URL like `?search=`

If your app doesn't have a use-case for empty query parameters, you can remove them from the URL by calling a function that throws a redirect response.<SideNote>Throwing the redirect is helpful because you don't have to worry about the return value of the function.</SideNote>

```ts
async function clearEmptyParams(url: URL) {
  let shouldRedirect = false
  for (const [key, value] of url.searchParams.entries()) {
    if (value === "") {
      url.searchParams.delete(key)
      shouldRedirect = true
    }
  }
  if (shouldRedirect) {
    throw redirect(url.toString())
  }
}
```

You can then call this function in your loader function on any route that uses GET forms.

```ts
export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	const url = new URL(request.url)
	await clearEmptyParams(url)

  â€¦
}
```
