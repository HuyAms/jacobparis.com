description: The useLocalStorageState hook works just like useState, but page navigations and refreshes won't reset it. Use React Suspense to avoid a Flash of Unstyled Content on the first render.

[Antonio Stoilkov](https://astoilkov.com/)<SideNote> Follow [Antonio on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=antoniostoilkov) </SideNote> built an excellent React hook for persisting state in local storage.

It's called [useLocalStorageState](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) and it works just like useState, but page navigations and refreshes won't reset it.

Let's look at a simple example of a form that needs a title and description.

- These are both uncontrolled inputs, so we're using `defaultValue` to set the initial value.
- We're also using `onChange` to track any updates in our state.

If the user refreshes the page before they submit the form, they won't lose any of their work.

```jsx
import { useLocalStorageState } from "use-local-storage-state"

export default function Page() {
  const [title, setTitle] = useLocalStorageState("title", {
    defaultValue: "",
  })
  const [description, setDescription] =
    useLocalStorageState("description", {
      defaultValue: "",
    })

  return (
    <form
      method="POST"
      onSubmit={(event) => {
        setTitle()
        setDescription()
      }}
    >
      <label>
        Title
        <input
          type="text"
          defaultValue={title}
          onChange={(e) => setTitle(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Description
        <input
          type="text"
          defaultValue={description}
          onChange={(e) => setDescription(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```
