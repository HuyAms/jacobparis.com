In the past, it was common for users to explicitly press a save button regularly as they used an application, like Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Word.

If they forgot to save, or the program crashed, or they overwrote their save file, they would lose hours of work or more.

But as the world moved toward cloud-based applications, autosave became the norm, and users have come to expect that if they make a change, it will be remembered.

<div>
  <iframe
    className="mx-auto max-w-full"
    width="560"
    height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OeOOdYZ17eY"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen
  />
</div>

In this guide, we'll show you how to use Remix's useFetcher hook to autosave form inputs on change or blur, and show a loading state while saving.

## The useSubmit hook is canceled on navigation but useFetcher isn't

The natural choice for submitting a form programmatically is the `useSubmit` hook, but it's not a good choice for auto-saving forms.

Remix uses a global navigation state, so if you click a link to one page and then before it loads, you click a link to a different page, the request for the first page will be cancelled.

Unfortunately, `useSubmit` also uses the same navigation state. If you use `useSubmit` to submit a form, and then navigate to a different page before it completes, the form submission will be cancelled.

That might make sense for a form that you explicitly submit, but for an input that is expected to save automatically, you don't want the save to fail just because the user clicked a link too quickly.

Every `useFetcher` hook gets its own state, so you can use it to make a request that will not be cancelled if the user navigates away.

## Set up the form with a fetcher

Instead of using the regular Remix `<Form />` component, use one returned by the fetcher at `fetcher.Form`.

This example will use conform<SideNote> [Conform](https://conform.guide/) is a form validation library. but it's a great way to manage form state in Remix. </SideNote> to manage the form state, but you can use regular HTML attributes if you prefer.

```tsx
import { useFetcher } from "@remix-run/react"
import { conform, useForm } from "@conform-to/react"

export default function Example() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher()

  const [form, fields] = useForm<{
    email: string
    name: string
  }>()

  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="POST" {...form.props}>
      <input {...conform.input(fields.email)} />
      <input {...conform.input(fields.name)} />

      <button type="submit">
        {fetcher.state === "submitting"
          ? "Saving…"
          : "Save"}
      </button>
    </fetcher.Form>
  )
}
```

## Add a debounced autosave

We'll use an enhanced [useDebounceFetcher](/content/use-debounce-fetcher) hook that will automatically debounce its submissions for the individual inputs.

If a user types quickly and tabs to each next input seamlessly, never pausing while filling out a large form, a lot of time can pass with their work unsaved. To avoid that, I like to make sure each input is autosaved individually.

- If they pause for a moment while typing, the input will be saved.
- If they tab to the next input, the previous input will be saved immediately, without waiting for the debounce delay to pass.

Thanks to the useDebounceFetcher hook, we can do that with just a few lines of code.

Create an emailFetcher and call it inside the onChange and onBlur handlers for the email input.

```tsx
import { useFetcher } from "@remix-run/react"
import { conform, useForm } from "@conform-to/react"
import { useDebounceFetcher } from "./use-debounce-fetcher"

export default function Example() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher()

  const [form, fields] = useForm<{
    email: string
    name: string
  }>()

  const emailFetcher = useDebounceFetcher()

  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="POST" {...form.props}>
      <input
        {...conform.input(fields.email)}
        onChange={(event) => {
          emailFetcher.debounceSubmit(
            event.currentTarget.form,
            {
              replace: true,
              debounceTimeout: 500,
            },
          )
        }}
        onBlur={(event) => {
          emailFetcher.debounceSubmit(
            event.currentTarget.form,
            {
              replace: true,
            },
          )
        }}
      />

      <input {...conform.input(fields.name)} />

      <button type="submit">
        {fetcher.state === "submitting"
          ? "Saving…"
          : "Save"}
      </button>
    </fetcher.Form>
  )
}
```

You'll also need to do the same thing for the name input, but now is a good time to think about how abstract this and avoid repetition.

- prop level abstraction – make a function that takes a fetcher and returns an object `{ onChange(), onBlur() }` could work well. That would be similar to the `conform.input` function. You will still need to create a hook for each input though.
- component level abstraction – make an Input component, then create the fetcher and event handlers inside the component.

I like the component level abstraction because it keeps everything in one place and it also provides a place to add other features, or to put your tailwind classes.

```tsx
function CustomInput(
  props: React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>,
) {
  const fetcher = useDebounceFetcher()

  return (
    <input
      className="block w-96 rounded border border-gray-300 px-4 py-3 focus:ring-1 focus:ring-indigo-600"
      {...props}
      onChange={(event) => {
        fetcher.debounceSubmit(event.currentTarget.form, {
          replace: true,
          debounceTimeout: 500,
        })

        // optional: call the onChange prop if it exists
        props.onChange?.(event)
      }}
      onBlur={(event) => {
        fetcher.debounceSubmit(event.currentTarget.form, {
          replace: true,
        })

        props.onBlur?.(event)
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

Now you can use the DebouncedInput component instead of the regular input and it will automatically save on change and blur.

```tsx
return (
  <fetcher.Form method="POST" {...form.props}>
    <DebouncedInput {...conform.input(fields.email)} />
    <DebouncedInput {...conform.input(fields.name)} />
  </fetcher.Form>
)
```
