Uploading images is hard

For one thing, they're big. Most of your form submissions are a few hundred bytes of text data, but images are many kilobytes or even megabytes. If you're routing images through your own server, you become the middleman for all that traffic, for every one of of your users.

So even if you're handling form submissions yourself, you're going to want to use a third-party service for image uploads.

Here's what the ideal workflow looks like

1. Users select images to upload from a file input
1. Those images are automatically uploaded in the background to a third-party service
1. When the images finish uploading, they become hidden inputs with the URL of the uploaded image
1. The user submits the form and your server receives the form data, including the URLs of the uploaded images

## Selecting images to upload

It's very rare to see a regular file input in a modern application. Demands from designers and aesthetic-focused devs and users alike have pushed us to use custom inputs that are more visually appealing.

There's a lot of ways to do this, but I like to use [react-dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/) for many reasons

- It's easy to use
- It has a nice API
- You can drag+drop images onto it
- It works with multiple images
- You can access those images and display thumbnails for them
- It uses a file input under the hood

Optimistic UI for image uploads requires [displaying image thumbnails for selected images](/content/file-image-thumbnails). The moment the user has selected a file, they can see it on-screen.<SideNote> By default, a native file input will just show the filename </SideNote>

Using a file input is important because it means every device that is capable of uploading files will use its native file picker. Mobile devices will use the camera roll, desktops will use the file explorer, etc.

There are tricky parts to getting this right.

If you're trying to build a progressively enhanced experience, you'll need to make sure that the file input is still accessible to users who aren't using javascript, either because they've disabled it, or it failed to load for one of many many possible reasons.

Most users only want to see the fancy dropzone input, so you need to [hide the native file input unless they need it](/content/remix-hide-on-load).

## Uploading images in the background

There are a lot of image upload services out there, and I won't get into a full comparison here because your needs will vary. But look for two key features

- It should support generating an upload URL for direct uploads from the browser
- It should allow you to generate signed download URLs with a secret key

The first feature is important because it means you can upload images directly from the browser to the service, without routing them through your own server. That means you aren't the bottleneck for image uploads, and you don't have to worry about handling the traffic or paying for the bandwidth.

The second feature is important because it means you can keep the images private, and only allow access to them through your server. If you let users get ahold of unsigned URLs for their images, they can easily use you as a free image host.

I like to use [Cloudflare Images](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-images/) because it's what I have experience with, but there are many other options out there, like AWS S3.

## Displaying uploaded image thumbnails

Once the images have been uploaded, you'll need to sign the URLs and replace the pending image thumbnails with the uploaded image thumbnails.

At this point, refreshing the page would cause the user to lose their data, so if you're building a fully persistent UI you'll need to save the uploaded image URLs somewhere, like local storage or your database.

The database is a great choice here. By automatically saving the uploaded image URLs to the database, like as [a "draft" version of the form or post or message that the user is working on](/content/remix-form-autosave), you feed two birds with one scone.

- The user gets cross-device persistence, like Slack where they can write half a message and upload a few images on their phone, then finish it on their laptop before submitting.
- You, the developer, can just look up the draft image URLs server-side when the page loads and sign them before returning to the client,<SideNote> Once the user gets the unsigned image URL from the image host, they have to submit that to your server to be signed anyway.</SideNote> instead of coming up with a way to sign the URLs when you pull them from local storage.

When the browser finally gets the signed image URLs, it can replace the pending image thumbnails with the uploaded image thumbnails. You'll be able to [release the pending image thumbnails from memory](/content/file-image-thumbnails#avoiding-memory-leaks-with-useobjecturls) and let the browser garbage collect them.

But you can't just swap the image src and call it a day â€“ the browser still needs time to load the new image, so you'll need to keep the pending image around a little longer and [show it as a placeholder while the new image loads](/content/image-placeholders). If you don't do this, you'll see the pending image disappear for a second before the new image loads.

The uploaded image URLs also need to be represented as hidden form inputs so that they get submitted with the rest of the form data when the user finally gets around to submitting the form.

## Let the user delete images

The user needs to be able to delete the images they've selected. If there's no persistence at all, that should be as simple as hiding the image thumbnail and removing the corresponding hidden input. The uploaded URL will be forgotten in the cloud until it expires.

If you're persisting the form to a draft in your database, you'll need to send a mutation to update it there as well.

Optimistic UI for this feature means hiding the image client side the moment they click the delete button and then letting the server catch up.

Sometimes users will delete multiple images, one after another, before the server processes any of them. If you're storing which images should be optimistically hidden in state, that state won't update fast enough to be a reliable argument to the server when updating the draft.<SideNote> If you're passing a list of images to delete to the server, appending each image to an array or set in a stable ref will work fine.</SideNote>

## Show me the code!

I've [put together an example](/content/remix-image-uploads/example) that demonstrates all of this. I'm using Cloudflare Images for hosting but, as mentioned above, you can swap that out for whatever you want.
