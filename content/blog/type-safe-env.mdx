Environment variables are a way of configuring your application at runtime. Rather than hardcoding values into your code, you can tell your app to read values from the environment.

This is useful for things like API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information that you don't want to be stored in your codebase.

Since these are provided at runtime and not at build time, we can't statically guarantee that certain variables will be set or that they will be of the correct type.

That means if you try to access `process.env` in your IDE, it won't autocomplete the variables for you, and you won't get any type checking. When you try to access a variable, you'll have check to make sure it's defined before you use it.

Create a [side-effect only module](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#import-a-module-for-side-effects-only) named `env.server.ts`

We will use this to

- crash the application on startup if any required environment variables are missing
- and to add type definitions for the environment variables so we can get autocomplete and type checking in the IDE

## Create a Zod schema for your environment variables

Define a Zod schema for your environment variables. The easiest option is to set them all to `z.string()`, but you can get fancier with format checking and other validation if you want.

```ts
import { z } from "zod"

const zodEnv = z.object({
  // Database
  DATABASE_URL: z.string(),

  // Cloudflare
  CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_ACCOUNT_ID: z.string(),
  CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_API_TOKEN: z.string(),

  // Sentry
  SENTRY_DSN: z.string(),
  SENTRY_RELEASE: z.string().optional(),
})
```

## Fix process.env to use these types

By default, `process.env` is just a plain object with unknown values. Since we're enforcing that the environment variables match our Zod schema, we can tell TypeScript to treat `process.env` as if it has these types.

Zod's `TypeOf` utility will turn our Zod schema into the Typescript types we need.

```ts
import { TypeOf } from "zod"

declare global {
  namespace NodeJS {
    interface ProcessEnv extends TypeOf<typeof zodEnv> {}
  }
}
```

## Crash if any envs are missing

Environment variables can't be modified while the app is running. They're strictly set at startup, so if any aren't present, we'll want to shut down the app immediately.

```ts
try {
  zodEnv.parse(process.env)
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof z.ZodError) {
    const { fieldErrors } = err.flatten()
    const errorMessage = Object.entries(fieldErrors)
      .map(([field, errors]) =>
        errors ? `${field}: ${errors.join(", ")}` : field,
      )
      .join("\n  ")

    throw new Error(
      `Missing environment variables:\n  ${errorMessage}`,
    )

    process.exit(1)
  }
}
```

As early as possible in your application, import this module.

This code is defined outside of any functions or classes, so it will run immediately on import.

The best place would be in the `server.ts` file if you're doing a Node/Express app, or in `entry.server.ts` with the Remix App Server.

```ts
import "~/env.server"
```

## Complete code

```ts
// app/env.server.ts
import { z, TypeOf } from "zod"

const zodEnv = z.object({
  DATABASE_PATH: z.string(),
  CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_ACCOUNT_ID: z.string(),
  CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_API_TOKEN: z.string(),
})

declare global {
  namespace NodeJS {
    interface ProcessEnv extends TypeOf<typeof zodEnv> {}
  }
}

try {
  zodEnv.parse(process.env)
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof z.ZodError) {
    const { fieldErrors } = err.flatten()
    const errorMessage = Object.entries(fieldErrors)
      .map(([field, errors]) =>
        errors ? `${field}: ${errors.join(", ")}` : field,
      )
      .join("\n  ")

    throw new Error(
      `Missing environment variables:\n  ${errorMessage}`,
    )

    process.exit(1)
  }
}
```
